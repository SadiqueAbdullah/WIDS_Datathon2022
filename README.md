# WIDS_Datathon2022

# Overview:
The dataset and challenge The WiDS Datathon dataset was created in collaboration with Climate Change AI (CCAI) and Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab). WiDS Datathon participants will analyze differences in building energy efficiency, creating models to predict building energy consumption. Participants will use a dataset consisting of variables that describe building characteristics and climate and weather variables for the regions in which the buildings are located. Accurate predictions of energy consumption can help policymakers target retrofitting efforts to maximize emissions reductions.

The Process-flow steps followed in the python Note book "wids-datathon2022.ipynb" are mentioned below;
